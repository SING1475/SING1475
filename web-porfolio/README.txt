<!-- Challenges --> 
Major challenges for this project developing codes that provided appropriate scaling and sizing for each components considering that the project in such a manner that the components including texts as well as images shrink and expand according to the changes made within the site. 

<!-- Solution -->
The aforementioned issue was overcome by using "rem" for defining size for most of the components. This approach allows the components within this project to get resized with respect to the size of the root elements. Hence, the size of these components is changed with the changing size of the screen making the development of a responsive webpage much easier.
